## 👋 Hi there, I’m Audrey!
I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in Python, Linux systems, and internal tooling. I enjoy building tools that make engineering workflows smoother, infrastructure more reliable, and cross-team collaboration easier. My recent work has focused on supporting data center operations, improving developer experience, and solving real-world problems through thoughtful automation and clean, maintainable code.

## 🔍 I’m currently open to work
I’m actively seeking new opportunities in software engineering — particularly in roles focused on internal tools, platform engineering, or infrastructure-aware development. I'm excited to contribute to teams that value thoughtful engineering, collaboration across disciplines, and systems that just work.

If you're hiring or know of a team that could benefit from a Python-savvy developer with systems experience and a passion for improving internal tools, I'd love to connect!

## 💻 What I’m into:
Writing reliable Python code for automation, tooling, and data analysis

- Improving internal systems and workflows across engineering teams

- Debugging performance issues and validating system behavior

- Bridging the gap between infrastructure and development

- Documenting and communicating technical work clearly and effectively

## 🛠 Tech I use & like:
`Python` • `Linux` • `Bash` • `Git` • `Prometheus` • `Grafana` • `SLURM` • `Kubernetes`
