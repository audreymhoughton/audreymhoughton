I build scalable data and compute systems that transform complex datasets into
reliable, reproducible, and production-ready workflows.

My work sits at the intersection of data engineering, high-performance computing,
machine learning infrastructure, and applied analytics — spanning academic
research environments and large-scale GPU cloud operations.
